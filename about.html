                <p>Hey, I feel obligated to introduce myself. It can be difficult
                 to begin an introduction because you are so familiar with 
                 yourself. Let me try to gauge your impression of myself
                 based on my self-description. I hope my perception of 
                 myself and your perception of me are similar.</p>
